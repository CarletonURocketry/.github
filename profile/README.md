We are CUInSpace, [Carleton University's][cu-website] rocket engineering design team. We are a team of students 
dedicated to designing, building and flying high-powered rockets.

The team was founded by Will Zoratto in 2014 and has successfully launched several rockets at the [Spaceport America Cup
Rocketry Competition][spaceport] at Spaceport America, New Mexico.

## Teams

### Avionics

The avionics team is responsible for designing and manufacturing the telemetry systems of the rocket. These systems 
collect information about our elevation and speed and control the deployment of our recovery system. The avionics team 
is also responsible for tracking our rocket on the descent so that we can find it once it has landed.

### Aerostructures

The Aerostructures team is responsible for designing, manufacturing, and testing the air frame and structural components
of the rocket. This includes the body tubes, the fins, the nosecone, and the internal structure that keeps the rocket as
stable as possible during launch. Our aerostructures team works initially with CAD software to develop the design and 
then moves into composites manufacturing and metal machining work. Finally, the team uses both physical testing and 
modelling to determine whether the components they have designed will survive the launch and landing.

### Payload

The payload team designs and tests satellite hardware to be released from the rocket, including structures, computers, 
navigation, power generation, thermal control, optics, communication, sensors, attitude control systems, and a 
scientific payload.

Most of our development focuses on recreating spacecraft-grade satellite systems at low cost.

### Recovery

The recovery team designs and tests the parachutes, release mechanisms, and tethers for the rocket. The system consists
of a small drogue parachute for controlled descent from apogee to approximately 1500 feet above ground level, and a main
parachute for a soft landing.

### Propulsion

The propulsion sub team is responsible for the selection and handling of the rocketâ€™s motor for competition and the 
development of propulsion systems for future flights.

The team flies Cesaroni Technologies solid motors at their competitions in both the 10,000 ft and 30,000 ft class. 
Concurrently, a paraffin-nitrous hybrid is being developed as a part of a multi-year SRAD project.
